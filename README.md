# Searchable JSON Processor
<strong>Language: JS+Node</strong>

A few times now, I’ve worked on search/autocomplete projects, and needed node scripts to process the list of items into a quickly-searchable Trie/Dict datastructure.

I’m extracting the script into its own project, with some improvements to make it more general and reusable in the future.
